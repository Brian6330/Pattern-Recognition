Given the python output (see below), we can say that the euclidean and minkowski metric perform the best.  
I would take the euclidean, as it is faster to compute than minkowski.

The k value that seems best is k = 3 for euclidean.

K = 1; Accuracy: 0.886; Metric: euclidean  
K = 3; Accuracy: 0.89; Metric: euclidean  
K = 5; Accuracy: 0.884; Metric: euclidean  
K = 10; Accuracy: 0.873; Metric: euclidean  
K = 15; Accuracy: 0.847; Metric: euclidean  
K = 1; Accuracy: 0.168; Metric: manhattan  
K = 3; Accuracy: 0.18; Metric: manhattan  
K = 5; Accuracy: 0.203; Metric: manhattan  
K = 10; Accuracy: 0.2; Metric: manhattan  
K = 15; Accuracy: 0.216; Metric: manhattan  
K = 1; Accuracy: 0.046; Metric: cosine  
K = 3; Accuracy: 0.048; Metric: cosine  
K = 5; Accuracy: 0.044; Metric: cosine  
K = 10; Accuracy: 0.041; Metric: cosine  
K = 15; Accuracy: 0.031; Metric: cosine  
K = 1; Accuracy: 0.893; Metric: minkowski  
K = 3; Accuracy: 0.893; Metric: minkowski  
K = 5; Accuracy: 0.896; Metric: minkowski    
K = 10; Accuracy: 0.871; Metric: minkowski  
K = 15; Accuracy: 0.851; Metric: minkowski
